# Upgrade Guide

## `http_timeout` is now a duration string

The `http_timeout` provider argument changed from an integer number of seconds to
a Go duration string.

Before:

```terraform
provider "signoz" {
  http_timeout = 35
}
```

After:

```terraform
provider "signoz" {
  http_timeout = "35s"
}
```

Update any `http_timeout` value in your provider configuration — or the
`SIGNOZ_HTTP_TIMEOUT` environment variable — from a bare number of seconds to a Go
duration string: `35` becomes `"35s"`, `90` becomes `"1m30s"`. Durations accept
`s`, `m`, and `h` units. The default when unset is unchanged (`35s`).
