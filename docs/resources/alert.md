## Schema

### Required

- `alert` (String) Name of the alert.
- `alert_type` (String) Type of the alert. Possible values are: METRIC_BASED_ALERT, LOGS_BASED_ALERT, TRACES_BASED_ALERT, and EXCEPTIONS_BASED_ALERT.
- `condition` (String) Condition of the alert.
- `severity` (String) Severity of the alert. Possible values are: info, warning, error, and critical.

### Optional

- `broadcast_to_all` (Boolean) Whether to broadcast the alert to all the alerting channels. By default, the alert is only sent to the preferred channels. **Deprecated:** This field is no longer needed and will be ignored.
- `description` (String) Description of the alert.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether the alert is disabled.
- `eval_window` (String) The evaluation window of the alert. By default, it is 5m0s.
- `evaluation` (String) Evaluation configuration of the alert as JSON. Only used when schema_version is v2 or higher.
- `frequency` (String) The frequency of the alert. By default, it is 1m0s.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels of the alert. Severity is a required label.
- `notification_settings` (Attributes) Notification settings for the alert. Only used when schema_version is v2 or higher. (see below for nested schema)
- `preferred_channels` (List of String) Preferred channels of the alert. By default, it is empty.
- `rule_type` (String) Type of the alert. Possible values are: threshold_rule and promql_rule.
- `schema_version` (String) Schema version of the alert. By default, it is v1. For v2+ schemas, additional fields like evaluation and notification_settings are supported.
- `source` (String) Source of the alert. By default, it is <SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT>/alerts.
- `summary` (String) Summary of the alert.
- `version` (String) Version of the alert. By default, it is v4.

### Nested Schema for `notification_settings`

Optional:

- `group_by` (List of String) List of labels to group notifications by. By default, it is empty.
- `renotify` (Attributes) Renotify settings for the alert. (see below for nested schema)
- `use_policy` (Boolean) Whether to use notification policy. By default, it is false.

### Nested Schema for `notification_settings.renotify`

Optional:

- `alert_states` (List of String) List of alert states to trigger renotification. Possible values are: firing, nodata.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether renotify is enabled. By default, it is false.
- `interval` (String) Renotification interval (e.g., "25m0s"). By default, it is empty.

### Read-Only

- `create_at` (String) Creation time of the alert.
- `create_by` (String) Creator of the alert.
- `id` (String) Autogenerated unique ID for the alert.
- `state` (String) State of the alert.
